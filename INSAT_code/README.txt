Instructions for Running the INSAT Data Download and TPW Plotting Script

This folder contains a Python script to download INSAT-3D data (from MOSDACâ€™s Standing Order folder) and plot Total Precipitable Water (TPW) over the Indian region.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
âœ… How It Works:
When the script runs, it prompts the user:

Enter your choice:
1 - Use most recent 3 files
2 - Select a specific date
If you enter 1:
The script assumes the current date and
Connects to the StandingOrder folder on the SFTP server.
Downloads the .h5 files.
Computes and plots the average TPW from the most recent 3 files.

If you enter 2:
The script prompts you to enter a date in DD-MM-YYYY format. It:
Finds and downloads all .h5 files for that date in StandingOrder.
Computes and plots the average TPW for the specified date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Before You Run the Script:
You must modify the following fields in the Python script:

sftp_user = 'your_username'   # Replace with your MOSDAC username
sftp_pass = 'your_password'   # Replace with your MOSDAC password
input_dir = 'DownloadedFiles' #  Folder where data will be downloaded

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ðŸ“Œ Important Note
To download data using this script:
The required INSAT-3D TPW files must first be added to your Standing Order on the MOSDAC website.

You need to:
Log in to your MOSDAC account.
Add INSAT-3D Level-2 TPW products to your Standing Order list.

Only then will the script be able to access those files for download.

After modifying these things in the code, you are good to go...
