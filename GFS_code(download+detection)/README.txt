Instructions for running AR Detection Algorithm for GFS data

üìÅ Files Included:
Python script for AR detection
Land mask file (.mat format)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚öôÔ∏è Required Setup:
You will need to modify three directory paths in the script before execution:

datadir ‚Äì This is your input directory, where the GFS data files will go after getting downloaded.

output_dir- This is the directory where the GFS IVT Plots will get saved

datadir2 ‚Äì This is the output directory, where the script will save the generated GeoTIFF images of the detected Atmospheric Rivers.

land_mask_dir ‚Äì Path to the land mask .mat file (included in the ZIP). Ensure that this file is correctly referenced.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the paths are updated, the script is ready to run. It will output:

Detected AR object images (GeoTIFF format)
AR characteristics

Note: Make sure you have all the python libraries required in the code installed before running the python script.
