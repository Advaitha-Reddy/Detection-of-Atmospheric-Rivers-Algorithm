Instructions for Running the AR Detection Script on ERA5 Data

üìÅ Files Included:
Python script for AR detection
Land mask file (.mat format)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚öôÔ∏è Required Setup:
You will need to modify three directory paths in the script before execution:

datadir ‚Äì This is your input directory, where you should place the ERA5 data files (downloaded from the Copernicus Climate Data Store).

datadir2 ‚Äì This is the output directory, where the script will save the generated GeoTIFF images of the detected Atmospheric Rivers.

land_mask_dir ‚Äì Path to the land mask .mat file (included in the ZIP). Ensure that this file is correctly referenced.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
‚è≥ Threshold Calculation (Rolling Window):
The script uses a rolling window method to calculate the IVT threshold.

By default, it uses data from the previous 1 day.

You may customize the code to extend the rolling window‚Äîfor example, use the last 10 days of IVT data to calculate a more stable threshold.

üîç Example:
If you are detecting ARs for 12 January 2020, and using a 1-day window, download ERA5 data for 11 Jan and 12 Jan 2020.
If using a 10-day window, you‚Äôll need data from 2 Jan to 12 Jan 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once the paths are updated, the script is ready to run. It will output:

Detected AR object images (GeoTIFF format
AR characteristics

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: Make sure you have all the python libraries required in the code installed before running the python script.
